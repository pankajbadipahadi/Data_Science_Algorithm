# ðŸ“Š Data Science Algorithms

This repository contains my Data Science assignments and projects, covering a wide range of **Machine Learning (ML)**, **Deep Learning (DL)**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** algorithms.  
Each assignment demonstrates practical implementation, step-by-step explanation, and insights gained from applying these techniques.
